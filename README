first we generate a .fam file in R
then we convert into a ped-sim def file
then we edit that def file to only print out the right generations
then we run ped-sim and print its fam file
then we filter the IBD segments generated by ped-sim to reduce file size
then we analyze IBD sharing and # of genealogical paths
